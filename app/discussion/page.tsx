        <p>
          Media industry employers readily invoke “objectivity” as a
          professional responsibility. However, our analysis suggests that what
          counts as “objective” and what is deemed biased depends on factors
          including the background and identity of the worker; the prejudices of
          management; and external pro-Israel individuals and advocacy groups{" "}
          <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/world/canary-mission-israel-covert-operations/">
            exerting
          </a>{" "}
          pressure on any given media organization. As a result, the concept of
          objectivity has been used to reinforce dominant narratives as normal,
          reasonable, and neutral, while the perspectives of marginalized groups
          are more likely to be seen as fringe or biased. Newsrooms then often
          fail to publish stories that challenge the status quo or hold power to
          account.
        </p>
        <p>
          As our findings demonstrate, Palestinian, Middle Eastern, North
          African, and Muslim media workers are disproportionately scrutinized
          and discredited for alleged partiality when it comes to coverage of
          Israel-Palestine affairs. Those with clearly demonstrated bias or
          conflicts of interest that favor Israel frequently go unchecked.

        <p>
          Outside the newsroom, some publications have shown inconsistency in
          how they address different kinds of political speech. As NWU has
          documented, media workers have faced workplace retaliation and
          suffered attacks on their professional credibility after signing
          letters in support of journalists who are risking their lives to cover
          Gaza under bombardment. In contrast, past{" "}
          <a href="https://www.freegershkovich.com/">campaigns</a>{" "}
          <a href="https://pen.org/justice-for-jamal/">decrying</a> the
          targeting of journalists by other hostile governments have enjoyed
          widespread support, with media workers often using hashtags, online
          petitions, vigils, and other means of drumming up awareness and
          support—without receiving pushback from newsroom leaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several cases included in this report involve organizations like
          Canary Mission, StopAntisemitism.Org, HonestReporting, and the
          Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis (CAMERA).
          Such groups pressure media employers, often by labeling workers’
          social media posts criticizing Israel as antisemitic. Data{" "}
          <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/anti-muslim-anti-jewish-incidents-rise/story?id=104760450">
            suggest
          </a>{" "}
          that incidents of antisemitism, Islamophobia, and anti-Arab bias have
          all risen since October 7. At the same time, the conflation between
          antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment has allowed the former to be
          weaponized to stifle Palestinian voices and coverage critical of the
          Israeli government. It has also muddied data on antisemitism. For
          example, the Anti-Defamation League reported a 361-percent increase in
          antisemitic incidents between October and January, compared to the
          previous year. However 1,307 of 3,291 incidents were rallies
          “including antisemitic rhetoric, expressions of support for terrorism
          against the state of Israel and/or anti-Zionism.” Reporting by{" "}
          <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/11/11/palestine-israel-protests-ceasefire-antisemitic/">
            The Intercept
          </a>{" "}
          pointed out that, alongside clear examples of antisemitism, the ADL
          has included anti-Zionist protests led by Jews in its lists of
          antisemitic incidents.
        </p>
        <p>
          When presented with allegations of antisemitism, publishers are forced
          to choose between accepting a reputational risk by standing up for
          their workers or complying with a pro-Israel narrative and silencing
          critical voices. At a number of workplaces, employers have chosen
          suppression. A Washington Post{" "}
          <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/16/stop-antisemitism-twitter-zionism-israel/">
            exposé
          </a>{" "}
          reported that StopAntisemitism.org boasted about its social media
          posts, which often identify targeted individuals’ workplaces and
          social media profiles, leading to the firing or suspension of nearly
          three dozen people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, some media organizations have resisted pressure from
          external organizations and stood by media workers amidst attempted
          character assassinations. For example, when CAMERA accused Los Angeles
          Times Managing Editor Sara Yasin of harboring “pro-Hamas” sentiments
          for sharing posts that were critical of Israeli state actions, the
          publication’s management mounted a full-throated{" "}

            defense

          of Yasin. Unfortunately, examples like this are few and far between.

          We left several cases of potential retaliation out of our quantitative

          independently verify them. Still, many of these cases are worth

          Reporter Mehdi Hasan, formerly MSNBC’s highest-profile Muslim host, is
          known for his critical coverage of Israel and tenacious interviewing
          style. In November, Hasan pushed back against various false claims by
          a senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
          including the advisor’s suggestion that Israel had not killed children
          in Gaza. Within two weeks of that interview, MSNBC announced that

          his own media company, Zeteo. However, the secrecy around his show’s
          cancellation contributes to a sense that even high-profile journalists
          may not be safe from retaliatory dismissal if they cross invisible red
          lines drawn by management.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also encountered cases in which media workers reported editors
          killing commissioned pieces that expressed pro-Palestinian sentiments;
          other workers faced layoffs, cancelled appearances, or missed out on
          anticipated job offers after criticizing Israel online. Although these
          workers were not directly informed that these opportunities had been
          withdrawn due to their views on Palestine and Israel, they suspect
          that this was the cause.

          The findings of NWU’s self-censorship survey illustrate the silencing
          effect experienced by media workers, in both confirmed and suspected
          cases of retaliation. The 22 responses received between December 13
          and February 1 are best viewed as a snapshot of workers’ firsthand
          experiences with self-censorship across the media industry. Although
          the demographics and professional experience of respondents were
          diverse, nearly all of them reported pressure to self-censor for fear
          of professional consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          One respondent said that showing any support for Israel had become a
          “nonstarter” and that expressing Jewish identity felt risky. “I fear
          that even showing support for the concept of ‘Zionism’ would be
          twisted, as it has been all over the world, to mean something sinister
          and evil. It is this anti-Jewish sentiment that I greatly fear has
          taken hold among my colleagues and would leave me stigmatized in my
          field.” The respondent added, “I fear I would lose out on assignments
          in the short term.”
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the vast majority of respondents expressed concerns about
          expressing support for Palestinians or speaking critically about
          Israel. Twenty people, including three Jewish respondents, named views
          related to Palestine (including expression of solidarity with
          Palestinians, criticism of Israeli state actions, and the
          characterization of the Israeli military assault on Gaza as “ethnic
          cleansing” or “genocide”) as ones they felt pressure to withhold.

          “much more” pressure than before. Fifteen respondents explicitly named
          firing, blacklisting, and marginalization within the industry as among
          the consequences they expected would follow if they were to voice

          Nine of the respondents described new or newly enforced social media
          policies and/or contract provisions from companies where they worked

          limited the way they used social media for fear of professional
          consequences. About half of the survey respondents described staying
          home from public events and protests, and nine said they had not
          signed onto open letters or public statements expressing their views,
          which they might have otherwise signed under less hostile workplace
          conditions.

          “If I don't censor my own speech about Israel/Palestine, I’m afraid

          freelance writer based in California. An absence of explicit
          prohibitions was no comfort. “On the one hand, my current employer
          hasn't told anyone outright to avoid writing about Israel's illegal
          occupation and genocide of Palestinian people. On the other hand,
          there are hardly any published articles that focus on
          Israel/Palestine. That silent disconnect scares me,” the respondent
          continued.
        </p>
        <Subheading id={"3"}>The Role of Social Media</Subheading>
        <p>
          Engagement with social media platforms is a professional requirement
          for many media workers, yet these platforms also represent important
          outlets for personal expression and community formation. In addition
          to expecting media workers to use social media to promote their work,
          newsrooms often seek to reach new audiences by capitalizing on their
          workers’ engagement with identity groups and niche communities. This
          dynamic creates problems in the context of selectively applied
          objectivity standards. For example, a writer lauded for skillfully
          engaging with “Black Twitter” during the hiring process may be
          subsequently penalized for urging critical coverage of police
          shootings. And where there are clear guidelines, freelancers are less
          likely than staffers to be privy to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a lack of consensus around how media workers’ social media
          activity should be monitored, if at all. This means that censorship is
          often up to individual discretion and is unevenly applied. NWU’s data
          suggests that marginalized workers are disproportionately penalized
          for allegedly violating policies regarding social media usage and
          political speech, while others enjoy wide latitude.

          of Israel. This censorship not only undemocratically constrains public
          discourse, but also interferes with media workers’ access to
          information and ability to support their livelihoods by sharing their
          work. On October 15, Instagram notified the journalist and illustrator
          Molly Crabapple that her account would be hidden from non-followers,
          and she would be temporariely unable to go “live,” because she
          reposted a Democracy Now! article about Israeli violence in the West
          Bank. In response, she{" "}

          Finally, social media provides a powerful tool for individuals and
          organizations seeking to punish media workers for coverage that
          amplifies Palestinian perspectives. Doxxing, online harassment, and
          threats of violence transmitted over social media are favored tools
          for followers of groups like StopAntisemitism.org and Canary Mission.

          A silver lining to the widespread repression of speech is the power
          unions have demonstrated in their efforts to protect workers from
          actual or potential retaliation. One telling example occurred among a
          group of Hearst Magazine employees. On October 10, Samira Nasr,
          editor-in-chief of Harper’s Bazaar, used her personal Instagram to
          decry Israel’s communications blackout in Gaza. Her post{" "}

            introduced

          a new social media policy to prohibit employees from posting about
          “politically charged” events, including on their personal social media
          accounts. The policy encouraged employees to report one another for
          social media activity that could “impact the reputation or objectivity
          of Hearst Magazines” and mandated that posts must be “consistent” with
          the views expressed in the company’s publications.

          against the policy. Union members filed an unfair labor practices
          complaint with the National Labor Relations Board and encouraged
          workers to refuse to sign the egregious policy. In the end, the
          company stopped pressuring workers to sign the policy, but the
          complaint process is ongoing.

          “Hearst's claim that personal social media accounts are not to be used
          for posting personal opinions would be laughable if it weren't so
          concerning. We will not let these scare tactics work,” said Hearst
          union shop steward Zach Lennon-Simon. “The only good thing about this
          policy is that it has united all of us, union members and editorial
          managers, in their outrage at Hearst's attempts at authoritarianism.
          We remain committed to each other and to our fight against corporate
          censorship.”

          The New York Times Guild similarly pushed back against divisive
          management tactics, using a labor rights framework. The publication’s
          leaders launched a leak investigation after unidentified staff
          provided information to The Intercept about internal concerns
          regarding the paper’s handling of the October 7 sexual violence{" "}

          . As part of the investigation, Times management conducted a “targeted
          interrogation” of members of an employee resource group (ERG)
          consisting of Middle Eastern and North African workers. According to{" "}
          <a href="https://www.nyguild.org/post/Grievance">the NewsGuild</a>,
          which represents the New York Times Guild, “Members faced extensive
          questions about their involvement in MENA ERG events and discussions,
          and about their views of the Times’s Middle East coverage.” They were
          also asked to turn over the group’s membership list. New York Times
          Guild members{" "}

          declaring management’s tactics to be a violation of the Guild’s labor
          contract.

          Workers without the protection of a union lack a key resource for
          pushing back; freelancers, who largely lack the legal protections of
          full-time employees, are especially vulnerable. Our analysis
          underscores the importance of ongoing labor organizing—and solidarity
          between full-time staff and freelance workers—across the media
          industry. Media organizations that do not already protect their
          workers from retaliation are unlikely to start on their own. Workers
          must use their collective power to push employers to respect their
          workplace rights and uphold fair labor practices.
