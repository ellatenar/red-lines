        <Subheading>Summary of Results</Subheading>
        <p>
          NWU’s investigation identified widespread retaliation against media
          workers in response to the perception that they support the
          Palestinian cause or are critical of the Israeli government. Our
          online research, interviews with workers, and surveys did not unearth
          a similarly pervasive trend for media workers facing retaliation for
          speech perceived as supportive of Israel. In some cases, retaliation
          was driven by allegations of antisemitism—often by{" "}
          <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/6/anti-zionism-is-antisemitism-us-house-asserts-in-dangerous-resolution">

          </a>{" "}
          and{" "}
          <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/ihra-definition-antisemitism/">
            individuals
          </a>{" "}
          that conflated expressions of solidarity with Palestinians or
          anti-Zionist sentiments with antisemitism.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not necessarily endorse or condemn the comments or actions of
          the individuals in our report. NWU undertook this project in response
          to the needs expressed by media workers in the U.S. We are a
          worker-led organization, so our report centers workers and their
          grievances.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the extreme end of our retaliation findings, NWU identified 10
          cases where media companies fired staffers, terminated long-term
          contracts, or pressured an employee to resign for editorial choices,
          social media posts, or statements that expressed solidarity with
          Palestinians or criticized Israeli state action. Eight other cases
          involved editors canceling the assignments of freelance workers. (A
          ninth case involved assignments of staff workers being canceled.)
          Other workers faced canceled appearances or events and/or rescinded
          awards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Workers in our sample were most likely to suffer retaliation in the
          form of social media suppression, including via new, wide-reaching
          policies affecting dozens of workers at outlets including{" "}

          , with its roster of more than 25 brands. Signing open letters also
          spurred retaliation: 38 workers at the{" "}

          and 20 workers at the Australia-based{" "}

          </a>{" "}
          and The Age were restricted from covering certain topics after signing
          letters condemning the deaths of Palestinian journalists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, social media backlash escalated into harassment. Multiple
          cases included in our quantitative analysis are not described in the
          report, at the request of those impacted, due to online harassment
          that escalated to threats of violence or death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Twenty-four of the cases we gathered, impacting more than 60 people,
          involved U.S. institutions. Twenty of the cases, impacting more than
          45 people, involved institutions based in Canada, Australia, the
          United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result of such retaliation is not merely the deplatforming of a
          couple dozen media workers. Rather, it encompasses the silencing of
          countless others, for whom instances of retaliation serve as warnings
          against speaking out, now and in the future. The majority of the 22
          respondents to NWU’s self-censorship survey said that they felt more
          pressure than before October 7 to censor their speech.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our survey questions were intentionally open-ended, inviting
          participants to share their experiences of pressure to self-censor
          speech related in any way to Israel or Palestine. Twenty respondents
          said they felt that they should avoid public speech showing solidarity
          with Palestinians, criticizing Israeli state action, and/or
          characterizing the ongoing bombardment of Gaza as “ethnic cleansing”
          or “genocide.” Conversely, one respondent described pressure to avoid
          expressing support for Israel. Survey participants named firing,
          blacklisting, and marginalization within the industry as among the
          consequences they expected to face if they voiced their views on the
          topic.

          Some media workers were coerced or pressured by their employers to
          resign after expressing concern regarding Israeli state violence. A
          notable example is award-winning journalist Jazmine Hughes, who{" "}
          <a href="https://1ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F11%2F03%2Fbusiness%2Fmedia%2Fnew-york-times-writer-resign-israel-gaza-war.html">
            resigned
          </a>{" "}
          as a staff writer from the New York Times Magazine after signing an{" "}
          <a href="https://www.writersagainstthewarongaza.com/">open letter</a>{" "}
          put forth by the group{" "}
          <a href="https://www.writersagainstthewarongaza.com/">
            Writers Against the War on Gaza
          </a>
          , an ad hoc coalition formed after October 7. The magazine determined
          that signing the letter violated the publication’s policy on public
          protest. Jamie Lauren Keiles, a freelance journalist who maintained an
          annual contract with the publication, also announced that he would no
          longer contribute work to the magazine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keiles told{" "}

          that, in addition to raising the alarm on a humanitarian issue, his
          resignation was about pushing back on unfair conditions for contingent
          workers. “If an institution is not willing to give you a job, then
          what do you owe them?” Keiles said. “The idea that the magazine or the
          Times as a whole would have some hold on my speech just seemed
          ludicrous to me. So, in some way, it was a small amount of protest
          over the labor conditions in the industry at large.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Additional freelance workers lost work for speech related to Israel
          and Palestine, at times with less transparency from the organizations
          that commissioned and then punished them. After October 7, multiple
          freelancers had individual assignments related and unrelated to Israel
          and Palestine suddenly canceled and contracts left to expire. For
          example, the Poetry Foundation indefinitely{" "}

          One U.S. freelancer, who requested anonymity, told NWU that a local
          outlet she regularly wrote for killed three of her stories after she
          posted criticism on social media regarding Israel’s military campaign
          in Gaza. Of the three stories, which were lifestyle pieces unrelated
          to the Middle East, she was compensated for the two she had already
          filed and given no kill fee for the third. The freelancer’s editor
          told her the pieces were canceled because she had violated the
          publication’s social media policy but did not specify further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another case involved Lebanese Australian journalist Antoinette
          Lattouf, whose one-week contract as a substitute host for the ABC
          Sydney morning radio show was canceled after she posted a Human Rights
          Watch report accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon. A Sydney

        <Subheading>Assignment Restrictions</Subheading>
        <p>
          Restricting the assignments of media workers perceived as biased was
          another common disciplinary measure. As defined in this report,
          assignment restrictions can entail forbidding media workers from
          covering a beat or subject, whether temporarily or permanently, or
          suspending them from their jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two large news outlets restricted assignments for dozens of media
          workers who signed open letters related to Palestine. Management at
          the Los Angeles Times banned 38 employees from covering any stories
          related to Israel or Palestine for at least three months after they
          signed a letter condemning Israel’s killing of journalists in Gaza;
          the company claimed the letter violated its ethics policy. A report by
          the Los Angeles Public Press{" "}

            noted

          from the Los Angeles Times Guild’s Black Caucus critiquing the paper’s
          coverage of Black communities. According to the NewsGuild, which
          represents Los Angeles Times staff, 28 of the 38 people disciplined in
          this case were people of color, including seven of Middle Eastern,
          North African, or Muslim descent. By comparison, the newsroom is about
          half people of color, half white.

          In Australia, 20 journalists at The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age,

          by the publication Crikey, the publications’ executive editor

          Cancellation of Appearances and Events; Awards Rescinded

        <p>
          At least 10 media workers have had public appearances canceled or
          postponed. Most of the event cancellations appear to be responses to
          perceived appearance of antisemitism or insensitivity to those in

          Social Media Suppression, Online Harassment, and Doxxing
        </Subheading>
        <p>
          Social media suppression was the most common type of retaliation in
          our sample. Suppression ranged from newly restrictive company policies
          about online posting and managers suspending workers for posts, to the
          blocking of posts by social media platforms themselves. NWU documented
          16 such cases that impacted dozens of workers. Some escalated to
          online harassment and doxxing (publishing personal information online
          with malicious intent). Pro-Israel social media accounts and actors
          drove several cases of harassment and doxxing, and often accused the
          affected media workers of antisemitism or supporting terrorism.
        </p>
        <p>
          In one instance, Heba Macksoud, an Egyptian American Muslim woman
          working as a digital media consultant for nonprofits, received a
          torrent of online harassment and intimidation affecting her family’s
          wellbeing after she posted “I stand with Palestine” on a New Jersey
          neighborhood Facebook page. Locals posted information about where
          members of Macksoud’s family worked, spammed the website of her
          husband’s pharmacy with one-star reviews, and called her daughter’s
          former employer to claim that her daughter was a Hamas supporter.
          Macksoud is now hesitant to associate with organizations that support
          Palestinians, has changed her last name and profile picture online,
          and feels “terrified” to express herself on social media
          again—especially after seeing a suspicious car parked outside her
          house on a dead-end street for hours. Against the backdrop of

          hate crimes and harassment against Arabs and Muslims, media workers of
          these backgrounds have reason to fear for their safety and that of

          The Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis
          (CAMERA), a group dedicated to combating what it claims to be
          anti-Israel bias in the news, targeted the social media activity of
          six Middle Eastern staff journalists and one freelancer for the BBC.
          In response, the BBC{" "}

          Joseph told NWU that in the wake of the Jewish News article she faced
          extensive online harassment and was dropped by the UK magazine Stylist
          as a speaker on a panel. “In calling me out they opened me up to a lot
          of racist abuse as well. It put a target on my back,” she said. “We’re
          low-hanging fruit—I’m a black girl, I’m a freelancer, so it’s really

        <p>
          In an effort to avoid allegations of bias, multiple organizations have
          released new social media policies that typically leave management
          with significant discretion to decide whom to discipline. For example,
          The Guardian’s editor-in-chief, along with its senior U.S. and
          Australian editors,{" "}
          <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/guardian-bans-open-letters-and-social-posts-amid-row-over-israel-20231204-p5eoz1">
            announced
          </a>{" "}
          a new policy discouraging journalists from signing open letters or
          posting statements on social media that “risk compromising our
          editorial integrity.” According to the editors’ memo, “Senior editors
          will decide on any appropriate action on a case by case basis.” Some
          outlets are known to reprimand staffers and contributors for publicly
          criticizing the organization they work for—or its coverage.
        </p>
        <p>
          In at least one case, managers reprimanded a media worker for
          critiquing media coverage of Palestine on a private Instagram account
          (meaning it could only be viewed by approved followers). The staffer
          was temporarily barred from working on stories related to Israel or
          Palestine. They said that they are the only Muslim in their newsroom,
          and that white coworkers were not initially reprimanded for signing
          public letters supportive of Palestinians.

          Many media workers pay their bills by working for academic
