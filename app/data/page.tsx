        <p>
          NWU’s investigation identified widespread retaliation against media
          workers in response to the perception that they support the
          Palestinian cause or are critical of the Israeli government. Our
          online research, interviews with workers, and surveys did not unearth
          a similarly pervasive trend for media workers facing retaliation for
          speech perceived as supportive of Israel. In some cases, retaliation
          was driven by allegations of antisemitism—often by{" "}
          <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/6/anti-zionism-is-antisemitism-us-house-asserts-in-dangerous-resolution">

          and{" "}

          </a>{" "}
          that conflated expressions of solidarity with Palestinians or
          anti-Zionist sentiments with antisemitism.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not necessarily endorse or condemn the comments or actions of
          the individuals in our report. NWU undertook this project in response
          to the needs expressed by media workers in the U.S. We are a
          worker-led organization, so our report centers workers and their
          grievances.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the extreme end of our retaliation findings, NWU identified 10
          cases where media companies fired staffers, terminated long-term
          contracts, or pressured an employee to resign for editorial choices,
          social media posts, or statements that expressed solidarity with
          Palestinians or criticized Israeli state action. Eight other cases
          involved editors canceling the assignments of freelance workers. (A
          ninth case involved assignments of staff workers being canceled.)
          Other workers faced canceled appearances or events and/or rescinded
          awards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Workers in our sample were most likely to suffer retaliation in the
          form of social media suppression, including via new, wide-reaching
          policies affecting dozens of workers at outlets including{" "}

          , with its roster of more than 25 brands. Signing open letters also
          spurred retaliation: 38 workers at the{" "}

          and 20 workers at the Australia-based{" "}

          </a>{" "}
          and The Age were restricted from covering certain topics after signing
          letters condemning the deaths of Palestinian journalists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, social media backlash escalated into harassment. Multiple
          cases included in our quantitative analysis are not described in the
          report, at the request of those impacted, due to online harassment
          that escalated to threats of violence or death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Twenty-four of the cases we gathered, impacting more than 60 people,
          involved U.S. institutions. Twenty of the cases, impacting more than
          45 people, involved institutions based in Canada, Australia, the
          United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result of such retaliation is not merely the deplatforming of a
          couple dozen media workers. Rather, it encompasses the silencing of
          countless others, for whom instances of retaliation serve as warnings
          against speaking out, now and in the future. The majority of the 22
          respondents to NWU’s self-censorship survey said that they felt more
          pressure than before October 7 to censor their speech.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our survey questions were intentionally open-ended, inviting
          participants to share their experiences of pressure to self-censor
          speech related in any way to Israel or Palestine. Twenty respondents
          said they felt that they should avoid public speech showing solidarity
          with Palestinians, criticizing Israeli state action, and/or
          characterizing the ongoing bombardment of Gaza as “ethnic cleansing”
          or “genocide.” Conversely, one respondent described pressure to avoid
          expressing support for Israel. Survey participants named firing,
          blacklisting, and marginalization within the industry as among the
          consequences they expected to face if they voiced their views on the
          topic.

          Some media workers were coerced or pressured by their employers to
          resign after expressing concern regarding Israeli state violence. A
          notable example is award-winning journalist Jazmine Hughes, who{" "}
          <a href="https://1ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F11%2F03%2Fbusiness%2Fmedia%2Fnew-york-times-writer-resign-israel-gaza-war.html">

          put forth by the group{" "}

            Writers Against the War on Gaza
          </a>
          , an ad hoc coalition formed after October 7. The magazine determined
          that signing the letter violated the publication’s policy on public
          protest. Jamie Lauren Keiles, a freelance journalist who maintained an
          annual contract with the publication, also announced that he would no
          longer contribute work to the magazine.

          that, in addition to raising the alarm on a humanitarian issue, his
          resignation was about pushing back on unfair conditions for contingent
          workers. “If an institution is not willing to give you a job, then
          what do you owe them?” Keiles said. “The idea that the magazine or the
          Times as a whole would have some hold on my speech just seemed
          ludicrous to me. So, in some way, it was a small amount of protest
          over the labor conditions in the industry at large.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Additional freelance workers lost work for speech related to Israel
          and Palestine, at times with less transparency from the organizations
          that commissioned and then punished them. After October 7, multiple
          freelancers had individual assignments related and unrelated to Israel
          and Palestine suddenly canceled and contracts left to expire. For
          example, the Poetry Foundation indefinitely{" "}

          One U.S. freelancer, who requested anonymity, told NWU that a local
          outlet she regularly wrote for killed three of her stories after she
          posted criticism on social media regarding Israel’s military campaign
          in Gaza. Of the three stories, which were lifestyle pieces unrelated
          to the Middle East, she was compensated for the two she had already
          filed and given no kill fee for the third. The freelancer’s editor
          told her the pieces were canceled because she had violated the
          publication’s social media policy but did not specify further.

          Another case involved Lebanese Australian journalist Antoinette

          Watch report accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon. A Sydney

        <p>
          Restricting the assignments of media workers perceived as biased was
          another common disciplinary measure. As defined in this report,
          assignment restrictions can entail forbidding media workers from
          covering a beat or subject, whether temporarily or permanently, or
          suspending them from their jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two large news outlets restricted assignments for dozens of media
          workers who signed open letters related to Palestine. Management at
          the Los Angeles Times banned 38 employees from covering any stories
          related to Israel or Palestine for at least three months after they
          signed a letter condemning Israel’s killing of journalists in Gaza;
          the company claimed the letter violated its ethics policy. A report by
          the Los Angeles Public Press{" "}

          from the Los Angeles Times Guild’s Black Caucus critiquing the paper’s
          coverage of Black communities. According to the NewsGuild, which
          represents Los Angeles Times staff, 28 of the 38 people disciplined in
          this case were people of color, including seven of Middle Eastern,
          North African, or Muslim descent. By comparison, the newsroom is about
          half people of color, half white.

          In Australia, 20 journalists at The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age,
