          The following recommendations were drafted by members of NWU
          organizing via the Freelance Solidarity Project (FSP). We believe in
          the power of unions to counter retaliation within newsrooms and
          workplaces and defend workers’ and citizens’ rights to dissent at
          local, national, and international levels. While these recommendations
          involve changes in policy and practice by political leaders and media
          organizations, organized workers play a key role in making these
          demands a reality.

          Media organizations must take proactive steps to protect such workers
          from retaliation, harassment, and harm. They should also track the
          diversity of their workforces—including details about which workers
          are receiving high-profile, high-reward opportunities—and make that
          data public.

          Further, publications should invite Middle Eastern, North African, and

          Stand up to efforts by interest groups to label criticism of Zionism
          or Israel as antisemitism.
        </PullQuote>
        <p>
          Media organizations and cultural institutions should anticipate and
          resist pressure from pro-Israeli interest groups like Canary Mission,
          StopAntisemitism.Org, HonestReporting, and CAMERA. Such groups
          routinely label speech critical of Israel or supportive of
          Palestinians as antisemitic and seek to influence employers to
          discipline or dismiss crucial media workers. When employers bow to
          such pressure, it is often Middle Eastern, North African, and Muslim
          workers, particularly workers of color, who pay the price. We call on
          all media organizations to stand by their employees and freelancers in
          the face of attempted character assassinations and smear campaigns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Media organizations must make a public commitment to resisting
          pressure from interest groups. Organizations should publicly and
          transparently document attempted pressure, as part of their commitment
          to journalistic ethics. Media industry employers can work together, in
          collaboration with media unions, to resist these pressure groups.

          Re-examine policies related to political speech and the
          disproportionate impact of such policies on marginalized workers.
        </PullQuote>
        <p>
          NWU’s data suggest that, in the case of Israel and Palestine, policies
          and practices designed to limit political speech are
          disproportionately impacting workers from marginalized backgrounds and
          identities. In light of this, newsrooms must critically re-examine
          their policies regarding political speech and social media. Achieving
          true diversity and inclusion will require identifying disparities and
          double standards in company attitudes and procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Policy changes should be made with input from rank-and-file workers,
          particularly staffers and freelancers who are most likely to be
          impacted, and clearly communicated to those workers. Policies that
          cannot be enforced equitably, or that reflect built-in bias, should be
          discontinued.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, freelancers should not be subject to the same restrictions on
          political speech as staffers; it is inequitable to enforce the same
          restrictions on workers who lack the same benefits and security as
          staff.

          organizations should employ a public editor to advocate for fair and

        <p>
          Multiple cases in our analysis demonstrate the power of unions to
          protect workers from retaliation and arbitrary discipline. We
          encourage all media workers to continue the urgent business of
          organizing in order to fight the current wave of retaliation and
          prevent those targeted on the basis of their identity from being
          further isolated. Media workers in non-unionized workplaces can reach
          out to the NewsGuild at{" "}

          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Then: Use the power of your union to expand those rights. Use contract
          negotiations to demand specific protections against retaliation. “Just
          Cause” contract provisions, for example, can{" "}
          <a href="https://www.labornotes.org/2019/01/using-just-cause-defend-against-unfair-discipline">
            protect workers
          </a>{" "}
          from politically motivated or arbitrary firings in retaliation for
          speech. Organize strong internal support networks or affiliation
          groups so that workers of marginalized identities are not easily
          isolated. Advocate for greater transparency and distributed power over
          editorial guidelines and decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unions should also be dogged and relentless about filing grievances on
          behalf of workers who have been disciplined for their speech. If the
          costs of retaliation begin to outweigh employers’ desire to control
          their workers, retaliation will become less common.
        </p>
        <p>
          Workers can also use the power of their unions to demand transparency
          about the external forces that result in retaliation against their
          colleagues, such as editors’ or management’s ties to political
          advocacy, or pressures editors have faced from outside groups.
          Overall, workers should examine the recommendations in this report and
          consider how they can use their knowledge of their workplace and the
          collective power of their union to push for change.

          Media unions should forge alliances with other unions and labor groups

          Freelancers: Join the National Writers Union.

          Freelancers are largely left out of the protections afforded to staff
          members under union contracts. The increasing precarity and volatility
          of media industry employment is a background condition throughout this
          report, as hundreds of media workers have been{" "}

          </a>{" "}
          since October 2023. The decline of unionized staff jobs means that
          journalists in general will be increasingly vulnerable to retaliation
          and targeting, unless freelancers organize to protect themselves and
          one another. Freelance media workers should get in touch with the
          Freelance Solidarity Project, organized under the Digital Media
          Division of the National Writers Union, at
