          While media workers around the world face retaliation for criticizing
          the Israeli and U.S. governments and speaking out in support of
          Palestine, most foreign journalists have not been allowed to enter
          Gaza. Israel refuses to allow outside press into Gaza unless they
          embed within the Israeli army, further isolating the media in Gaza
          from the international community. More than 50 senior broadcast
          journalists from outlets including CNN, BBC, Sky News, Channel 4, and
          others{" "}

          Notably, companies outside of the Middle East have also prevented
          much-needed aid from reaching Palestinian journalists, who are the
          world’s main eyes on the war. For example, GoFundMe{" "}

          Many Palestinian journalists continue to do their work even as they
          bury their family members and colleagues. They have been performing
          their jobs with rigor and professionalism under immense duress—in
          constant fear of death or injury and with limited access to food,
          shelter, and basic protective equipment like helmets and safety vests.

          air strikes or sniper fire, meaning that either their homes or

          The rate at which journalists have been killed in Gaza is staggering,
